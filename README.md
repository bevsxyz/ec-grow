# EC-Grow

Simple scripts to automate growth curve analysis!!

We use a python script to tidy up data and R script (will be updated) to plot the data.

A single script in python is on the works.

## How to get started?

Required dependencies:

1. git (optional)
2. python3
3. pip3
4. R package

First up clone this repo.

```console
git clone https://github.com/chain-ed-reaction/ec-grow.git
```

Or you can simply download a zip archive and extract it.

Change directory to that of the repo.

To install the python packages we use in our scripts

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For sample run

```
./ec-grow.py sample/Part\ 1.txt sample/Part\ 2.txt sample/Part\ 3.txt
```
